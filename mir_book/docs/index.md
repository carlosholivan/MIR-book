# Music Information Retrieval Fundamentals: From Classic Algorithms to Deep Learning approaches


[**Carlos Hernandez-Olivan**](https://carlosholivan.github.io)


<!-- #endregion -->

This lectures contain the basic concepts of Music Information Retrieval and also new Deep Learning models that have been used in MIR. The idea is to introduce new undergraduate students to MIR. 


The rendered book can be found here: 

[https://carlosholivan.github.io/resources/mir/index.html](https://carlosholivan.github.io/resources/mir/index.html),

in the left menu select any chapter below the Introduction, click the "rocket" icon at the top right of the screen, and choose â€œBinder". After some initialization time (for the first time it is rather long) the notebook can be run.

For local running, the codes for each chapter in the form of 
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks can be downloaded by clicking the "arrow-down" icon at the top right of the screen. A complete set of files is also available from the links given above.

Appendix {ref}`app-run` explains step-by-step how to proceed with the local execution of the codes.
